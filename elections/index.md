## Bylaws 

These rules were adopted at the Business Meeting at the TABLEAUX Conference in
St. Andrews, July 6, 2000, and amended by email vote in January 2005 and by
vote at the Business Meeting at TABLEAUX 2019.


1. The TABLEAUX Steering Committee (TSC) consists of six elected members and
   the Conference and Program Chair(s) of the current and the previous
   Conference. The elected members serve for three year terms. The TSC may
   decide to introduce for its elected members overlapping terms not all ending
   at the same time.
2. The responsibilities and obligations of the TSC consist of
  * Select venues for future TABLEAUX Conferences
  * Select program and conference chairs for future TABLEAUX Conferences.
    Program and conference chair may be the same person.
  * Make decisions concerning the future of the TABLEAUX Conference series
  * Call a business meeting at each TABLEAUX Conference. At the meeting the
    President shall report on the activities of the TSC during the previous
    year and put controversial issues to a vote.
  * Initiate elections
3. The TSC appoints among its members a President and Vice President to conduct
   its duties and represent the TSC.
4. The members of the TSC will be elected by the TABLEAUX community. Votes may
   be cast by e-mail or online as determined and communicated by the TSC. The
   TABLEAUX community consists of all people that have been registered
   participants in at least one of the 3 most recent TABLEAUX Conferences and
   all members of the current Program Committee. Nominations can be made by any
   member of the community, either by e-mail or in person at a TABLEAUX
   business meeting. Two members, a principal nominator and a second, are
   required to make a nomination, and it is their responsibility to ask
   people's permission before nominating them. A member may nominate or second
   only one candidate.
5. Transitional path. The first TSC will be elected at the business meeting
   during the TABLEAUX Conference at St Andrews, 2000, by the members of the
   TABLEAUX community then present.
