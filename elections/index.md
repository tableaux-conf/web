# Steering Committee Elections

In 2024 members of the TABLEAUX community will choose 3 new Steering Committee Members. Below the statements of the candidates.

## Hans de Nivelle

In general, science is under pressure, because of governments
taking away funding from education, and because of the increasing
application of numeric metrics whose validity is not questioned. 
Within these constraints, one should try to preserve as much as possible
the original goals of research.

- TABLEAUX should think about the meaning of the brand 'TABLEAUX'. Do we
  want to pick up papers after CADE, or can we define an area
  where TABLEAUX is first choice. TABLEAUX is traditionally tolerant
  towards proof theory and non-standard logics. We could try to
  focus on that, but at the same time we should avoid becoming too esoteric.
  Alternatively, we could try to become more implementation friendly.  
  It has the advantage that implementation is always concrete. 

- The ongoing discussion about moving to an open source publisher.
  It is a complicated issue: We have to think about the consequences
  in different places in the world, and about the long term future. 
  It seems that IJCAR has already decided to try to move to
  LIPIcs, and TABLEAUX cannot go on a single trip, so I am in favour to
  stay with IJCAR.
 
- CS conferences should be more implementator friendly. This does not
  mean that we should simply accept more implementationp papers.
  It means that we must develop criteria, and reviewers must seriously
  spend time to applying these reviewing criteria. 

- Selecting conference sites is the responsibility of the steering committee.
  I think that conferences like TABLEAUX should be organized by scientist
  themselves in their own institute.

This statement is for my re-election to the TABLEAUX Steering Committee (TSC). It’s been an honor to serve as the Chair of TSC, and I’m excited about the possibility of contributing for one more term.

My journey with TABLEAUX started back in 2002 when I presented my first paper at the conference in Copenhagen. Since then, I’ve been an active and passionate member of our community, deeply involved in research, collaboration, and sharing knowledge. My main research focus is proof theory, and I've always aimed to increase the visibility and representation of this area in the community.

As Chair of the TSC, I’ve taken on various initiatives, like promoting the SC elections, building a new web page, updating our members list, choosing the venue for the 2025 edition, and starting discussions about our publication venue. I’ve also worked hard to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.

If re-elected, I’ll continue to push for the interests of our community, especially in terms of enhancing our conference's visibility and supporting the professional growth of our members, with a particular focus on early-career researchers.

## Revantha Ramanayake
My research centers on proof systems and the properties of non-classical logics. I consider TABLEAUX to be my home conference as it is the conference that aligns most closely with my research interests. Over the years, I have enjoyed contributing to the TABLEAUX community, including as PC co-chair for TABLEAUX 2023.

I view TABLEAUX as the primary gathering for researchers interested in all aspects of tableaux-like methods and their applications, theoretical and applied. For this reason, I believe that TABLEAUX should maintain the balance of good-quality publications and accessibility (as a publication venue) for this broad community. I would promote initiatives that reinforce TABLEAUX's place as the primary meeting point for this community.

## Michał Zawidzki
I am employed in the Department of Logic at the University of Lodz, where I hold an appointment as an assistant professor. I am also a researcher in the project “Coming to Terms: Proof Theory Extended to Definite Descriptions and other Terms” led by prof. Andrzej Indrzejczak. Between June 2020 and June 2023 I worked as a senior research associate in AI and semantic technologies at the Department of Computer Science at Oxford University. 

As a researcher, I have had an opportunity to gain experience in almost all aspects of academic work, spanning, inter alia, standard publication activities and disseminating the results at conferences and workshops, editing collective volumes and proceedings, organising big-scale conferences as well as smaller workshops, or participating in various academic bodies such as admissions committees or course program committees.

I seek election to the Steering Committee of TABLEAUX since I believe that my prior experience in organising conferences in the series “Non-Classical Logics. Theory and Applications”, where I coordinated or co-coordinated various activities such as advertising, submission management, reviewing, or scheduling, can be of benefit to the Committee in the context of supervising the process of organising next editions of the TABLEAUX conference. Moreover, one of my aims, as a philosopher, would be to broaden the TABLEAUX community by reaching out to those researchers who, on the one hand, work on deduction, broadly construed, but on the other, have never attended any of the TABLEAUX events as philosophical logicians.

For the reasons stated above I believe that I am a suitable candidate for the role of a member of the Steering Committee of TABLEAUX.
