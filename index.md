## Welcome!

Tableau methods have been found to be a convenient formalism for automating
deduction in various non-standard logics as well as in classical logic. Areas
of application include verification of software and computer systems, deductive
databases, knowledge representation and its required inference engines, and
system diagnosis.

The International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and
Related Methods (TABLEAUX) brings together researchers interested in all
aspects - theoretical foundations, implementation techniques, systems
development and applications - of the mechanization of reasoning with tableaux
and related methods.

TABLEAUX has been held every year since 1992. Starting in 1995, the proceedings
have been published in Springer's LNCS/LNAI series.

## Aims and Topics

The International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and
Related Methods (TABLEAUX) brings together researchers interested in all
aspects - theoretical foundations, implementation techniques, systems
development and applications - of the mechanization of reasoning with tableaux
and related methods.

Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):

* analytic tableaux for various logics (theory and applications)
* related techniques and concepts (e.g., model checking and BDD's)
* related methods (e.g., model elimination, sequent calculi, connection method)
* new calculi and methods for theorem proving in classical and non-classical logics (e.g., modal, intuitionistic, linear, temporal)
* systems, tools, implementations and applications (e.g., verification)
