# Aims and Topics

The International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and
Related Methods (TABLEAUX) brings together researchers interested in all
aspects - theoretical foundations, implementation techniques, systems
development and applications - of the mechanization of reasoning with tableaux
and related methods.

Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):

* analytic tableaux for various logics (theory and applications)
* related techniques and concepts (e.g., model checking and BDD's)
* related methods (e.g., model elimination, sequent calculi, connection method)
* new calculi and methods for theorem proving in classical and non-classical logics (e.g., modal, intuitionistic, linear, temporal)
* systems, tools, implementations and applications (e.g., verification)
